==== Blacklisting ====

The internet isn't the place it used to be anymore. Everything good gets corrupted and so it is with Wikis. WikiSpam, like Spam in blogs and email, is on the rise. If you use DokuWiki in your Intranet this is no problem for you. But if you intend to use it on the open Internet you may want to blacklist some known Spam words.
