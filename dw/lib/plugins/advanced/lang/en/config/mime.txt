==== MIME Types ====

Which file types you can upload via the media manager popup or the fullscreen media manager is configured through the ''conf/mime.conf'' file. Additional mimetypes should be added in ''mime.local.conf''. The file expects an extension (without the dot) and a mime type. Prefixing the mime type with an exclamation mark (!) will force the browser to present a download dialog, even if a browser plugin for the file in question exists.

=== Example of mime.conf ===

<code>
# this would play in the browser (if supported):
wav         audio/wav

# this would be downloaded
wav         !audio/wav
</code>

File type icons can be added by placing an image file (PNG or GIF) named after the file extension into ''lib/images/fileicons/''.

**Note:** because the stylesheet used for assigning the fileicons gets cached you need to force a rebuild by touching one of the config files.
