==== Smiles ====

DokuWiki can convert text smileys to their graphically equivalent. The default smileys images are stored in the ''lib/images/smileys/'' directory and configured in the ''conf/smileys.conf'' file. The local and upgrade-safe directory of smiles images are stored in ''lib/images/smileys/local'' directory and configured in the ''conf/smiles.local.conf''.

=== Example of smileys.conf ===

<code>
:MYFACE:                local/i_am_so_pretty.jpg
</code>
