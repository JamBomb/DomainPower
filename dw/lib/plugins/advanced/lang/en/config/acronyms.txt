==== Abbreviations and Acronyms ====

DokuWiki can mark abbreviations and acronyms (terminology) automatically. You can hover your mouse on an abbreviation to see a short explanation, shown as a tooltip. For example, if the mouse is positioned over “CMS” (which is included in the default acronyms list), the tooltip displays Content Management System.

=== Example of acronyms.conf ===

<code>
CMS          Content Management System
